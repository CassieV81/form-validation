# Form Validation

This is a simple HTML form with JavaScript and Bootstrap that demonstrates form validation. 

The purpose of this project is to practice using form validation with JavaScript and Bootstrap to create a more user-friendly and responsive web application. The form includes email, zip, country, password, and confirm password fields. The user will be given feedback on the validity of their input in real-time, and the confirm password field is validated against the password field to ensure they match.
